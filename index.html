    <h2>Welcome To Our Official Website</h2>
    <p>Aquatic animals play a vital role in maintaining the balance of our planet’s ecosystems, from tiny plankton to majestic whales. However, water pollution caused by plastic waste, chemicals, and oil spills is threatening their survival and disrupting marine habitats. Many species are becoming endangered or dying prematurely due to contaminated waters, which also affects human life and the health of our oceans. It is urgent that we take immediate action by reducing pollution, promoting sustainable practices, and protecting aquatic life. Every effort counts, because the future of our oceans—and the creatures that inhabit them—depends on what we do today.</p>
    <p>We are dedicated to ensuring we eliminate water pollution which is majorly caused by us human beings ourselves</p>
    <p>Each of us can play a part in saving our waters and the animals. Every action counts</p>

      <p>Many aquatic animals mistake waste, especially plastics, for food, which leads to devastating consequences. Sea turtles often confuse floating plastic bags with jellyfish, while fish and seabirds swallow small plastic particles, thinking they are edible. Once consumed, this waste can block their digestive systems, cause internal injuries, or release toxic chemicals into their bodies. In other cases, animals become entangled in discarded fishing nets or other debris, suffocating or sustaining severe wounds that eventually lead to death. This tragic reality highlights how human negligence in managing waste directly endangers marine life and calls for urgent action to protect our oceans.</p>
